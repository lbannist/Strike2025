# Here is what the class is going over from Oct 1 until about Oct 15th

This section of the course is all virtual web-based, so easy to complete at home.  Go to [Vr.vex.com ](https://vr.vex.com/) and in there is an interface that is just like the mBot coding interface.  Press **Get Started as a Student** and then run through the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the interface.   
**Timeline for this work is 2 weeks.**

## 1) Wall Maze
Press **Select Playground** and find the Wall Maze to start.  You need to move the vexbot from 1 to 4 in order OR A to D in order.  To earn a higher mark, make sure to also include a wait time at each checkpoint.  Review the rubric for any further details.
Save a video (from your desktop) of your completed attempt and a screenshot of your code.
## 2) Dynamic Wall Maze
Press **Select Playground** and find the Dynamic Wall Maze to start.  You need to move the maze from start to finish, but each time your restart, the maze changes; so a long column of blue move commands won't work.  HINT - Take a look at the Front Eye detects red, if so, turn.
To earn a higher mark, make sure to also include a wait time at each checkpoint.  Review the rubric for any further details.

## 3) Initials
Press **Select Playground** and find the Art Canvas to start.  You need to move the vexbot and draw your first and last initials.  HINT - Take a look at the move pen up and down commands.  Think like the old etch-a-sketch
To earn a higher mark, make sure to also include a wait time at each checkpoint.  Review the rubric for any further details.

## 4) Disc Mover
Press **Select Playground** and find the Wall Maze to start. 
The objective is to code the magnet and sort the disks as per the colour code. Please upload an image of your code and completed course when complete.

1. Beginning: Using the electromagnet, pick up and place one disk of each color inside the correct colored goals located outside the Castle walls. (2/4)

And/Or

2. Proficient: Using the electromagnet, pick up and place all three disks of each color inside the correct colored goals. (3/4)

And/Or

3. Mastery: Using the electromagnet, pick up and place three disks of each color inside each colored goal! (4/4)
To earn a higher mark, make sure to also include a wait time at each checkpoint.  Review the rubric for any further details.

## 5) Storm the Castle / Castle Clean Up
Press **Select Playground** and find the Wall Maze to start.  
*Level 1: Drive around the Castle and knock over all five buildings by driving the VR Robot into them. << This is a Level 3 from Castle Crasher (the previous assignment)
*Level 2: Drive around the Castle and push each of the four small buildings off of the Playground.
*Level 3: Clear every building on the Castle's grounds by pushing all building pieces (including the Castle) off of the side of the Playground.

#### Helpful Hint:
Be careful not to fall off the side of the Playground because there are no walls!
Castle building pieces will be detected as objects by the Distance sensor.
Use the color sensing block from the Sensing category to detect the hazard area (black and red stripes) around the Playground. The hazard area is detected as color "red" to the DownEye sensor.
To earn a higher mark, make sure to also include a wait time at each checkpoint.  Review the rubric for any further details.

## 6) Corel Reef Cleanup
Press **Select Playground** and find the Wall Maze to start.  
Congratulations, you have completed all the VEX challenges and are now ready to take on a real-world problem. In this challenge your robot will be cleaning up the ocean by removing trash that is on the ocean floor. You only have a limited amount of power before your robot will shut down and return to the surface.

Your goal is to collect as much garbage as possible. **Last year someone cleaned up 125kg of garbage!!! Can you do better**

**0% max = Level 0** - The code has forced the VexBot to damage the coral reef.

**30% max = Level 1** - The code will contain blocks similar to the first assignment without any dynamic coding. the Vex robot will systematically clean the ocean floor, ignoring any new trash that appears in an area already cleaned.

**45% max = Level 2** - The code will make use of sensors, including the to find the trash and clean it up. These sensors will help find trash that has appeared in areas that have already been cleaned.

**65% max = Level 3** - The code will be able to run until the battery runs out of power. It needs to include a forever loop. 

These accumulate (i.e. if you collect 72kg at a Level 2, then you would earn 45 + 5 + 5 + 10 = 65% + placement)
+5% above 40kg
+5% above 50kg
+10% above 60kg

*** Only assignments submitted on time will be considered for placement
+15% for the most garbage collected
+10% for the second most amount of garbage collected
+5% for the third most amount of garbage collected

Max = 100%
To earn a higher mark, make sure to also include a wait time at each checkpoint.  Review the rubric for any further details.
